25 apr 2012: letters: i'm concerned to know if the 'absolute confidence' the prime minister has in jeremy hunt is the same absolute confidence he had in andy coulson, liam fox and rebekah brooks' horse?
isabel mohan sees ruth brown almost bring the house down at the first live show of bbc one's the voice.
‘i need wine!
” declared holly willoughby as we approached the fifth hour of filming the voice ’s first “live” show.
 the delirious audience, high off the hairspray fumes blasted into danny o’donoghue’s quiff every time the cameras were off him, knew how she felt.
presumably to cut costs, the bbc has elected to film both the main live show and the results show on a saturday – even though the latter isn’t aired for another 24 hours.
 “please don’t tell your friends who gets voted off!
” the warm-up man begged, optimistically relying on the goodwill of 1000 excitable fans with multiple social media accounts.

this wasn’t the only awkward part of the six-hour endurance test.
 for a series so focused on great voices, lana del rey was an odd choice of booking.
 her new single blue jeans was one long bum note and she had the stage presence of one of jessie j’s discarded hair extensions.
still, there were a handful of great moments that made all the sitting around worth it.
 ruth brown’s rendition of oleta adams’s get here sounded even better in the studio than on tv – she had the audience stomping in their seats so hard that the flimsy set felt like it might topple (those giant statues of microphone-wielding hands look like swimming pool inflatables in real life).
